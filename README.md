🚀 Deployment via GitHub Pages
The website is hosted using GitHub Pages.

Go to the repository’s Settings → Pages.

Set the source branch to main and folder to / (root).

⚠️ Notes & Issues
Video file: Make sure the video file name has no spaces (your_home_in_space.mp4) and matches exactly in the HTML code.

File size limit: GitHub allows files up to 100 MB. If the video is larger, compress it before uploading.

Autoplay: For autoplay to work, videos must have muted set in the <video> tag.

📌 Future Enhancements
Optimize video for faster load times.

Add responsive design improvements for mobile.

Include fallback poster image if the video fails to load.

Expand content with more detailed system explanations.
